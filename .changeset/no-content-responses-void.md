A `204` or `205` response is now typed `void` in `types` and `z.void()` in `schemas`, which is what the client resolves its empty body to. It used to be typed `unknown`, which swallowed the other member of a `200 | 204` union, so `getEdgeConfigItem` in `vercel-api-js` and `entitlementsGetAccountEntitlements`, `entitlementsGetZoneEntitlements`, `accountBillingDeletePaymentMethod`, `accountBillingSetDefaultPaymentMethod` and `accountSubscriptionsCancelDelayedDowngrade` in `cloudflare-api-js` returned `unknown` instead of their `200` body or `undefined`. A `204` the spec declares with a body, such as `deleteSecurityFirewallConfigByConfigVersion` in `vercel-api-js` (typed `""`), is `void` as well, and its zod schema now accepts the `undefined` the client returns.
