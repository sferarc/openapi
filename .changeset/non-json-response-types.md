Type the responses the API sends as something other than `application/json` instead of `unknown`: a download the client resolves as a `Blob` (a zip, PDF, image or `application/octet-stream`) is typed `Blob`, a text body such as `text/plain` or a PEM file is typed `string`, and an `application/scim+json` body gets its schema. For example `chatsDownloadVersion` in `v0-api`, `readSessionFile` in `vercel-api-js` and Cloudflare's PDF, screenshot and KV value downloads.
